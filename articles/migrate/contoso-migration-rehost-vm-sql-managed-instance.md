# Contoso series: Rehost (migrate) an on-premises app to Azure VMs and SQL Managed Instance

This article shows you how Contoso migrate their SmartHotel app frontend VM to Azure VMs using the Azure Site Recovery service, and migrate the app database to an Azure SQL Managed Instance.

This document is the fourth in a series of articles that document how the fictitious company Contoso migrates their on-premises resources to the Microsoft Azure cloud. The series includes background information, and a series of scenarios that illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure, and run different types of migrations. Scenarios grow in complexity, and we'll be adding additional articles over time.

## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with their business partners to understand what the business wants to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth**: Contoso is growing and as a result there is pressure on their on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Increase efficiency**: Contoso needs to remove unnecessary procedures, and streamline processes for their developers and users.  The business needs IT to be fast and not waste time or money, thus delivering faster on customer requirements.
- Increase agility**:  Contoso IT needs to be more responsive to the needs of the business. It must be able to react faster than the changes in the marketplace, to enable the success in a global economy.  It mustn't get in the way, or become a business blocker.
- **Scale**: As the business grows successfully, Contoso IT must provide systems that are able to grow at the same pace.

## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for this migration. These goals are used to determine the best migration method:

- After migration, the app in Azure should have the same performance capabilities as it does today in their on-premises VMWare environment.  Moving to the cloud doesn't mean that app performance is less critical.
- Contoso doesnâ€™t want to invest in this app.  It is critical and important to the business, but in its current form they simply want to move it as is to the cloud.
- Database administrative tasks should be minimized after the app is migrated.
- Contoso doesn't want to use an Azure SQL Database for this app, and and is looking for alternatives.

## Proposed architecture

In this scenario:

- Contoso wants to migrate their two-tier on-premises travel app.
- The app is tiered across two VMs (WEBVM and SQLVM), and located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5)
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- They'll migrate the app database (SmartHotelDB) to an Azure SQL Managed instance.
- They'll migrate the on-premises VMware VMs to an Azure VM.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (contoso-datacenter), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

## Migration process

Contoso will migrate both their web and data tiers of the SmartHotel application to Azure.

1. Contoso already have their Azure infrastructure in place, so they need to add a couple of Azure components for this scenario.
2. The data tier will be migrated using the Data Migration Service (DMS).  DMS will connect to the on-premises SQL Server VM across a site-to-site VPN connection between the Contoso datacenter and Azure, and then migrate the database.

    ![DMS architecture](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/architecture-dms.png) 


2. The web tier will be migrated using a lift-and-shift migration with Azure Site Recovery. This will entail preparing the on-premises VMware environment, setting up and enabling replication, and migrating the VMs by failing them over to Azure.

## Prerequisites

If you want to run this scenario, here's what you should have.

Requirements | Details
--- | ---
**Enrol in preview** | You need to be enrolled in the SQL Managed Instance Limited Public Preview. You need an Azure subscription in order to [sign up](https://portal.azure.com#create/Microsoft.SQLManagedInstance). Sign-up can take a few days to complete so make sure you do it before you start to deploy this scenario.
**Azure subscription** | You should have already created a subscription when  you performed the assessment in the first article in this series. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).<br/><br/> If you create a free account, you're the administrator of your subscription and can perform all actions.<br/><br/> If you use an existing subscription and you're not the administrator, you need to work with the admin to assign you Owner or Contributor permissions.<br/><br/> If you need more granular permissions, review [this article](../site-recovery/site-recovery-role-based-linked-access-control.md). 
**Site recovery (on-premises)** | Your on-premises vCenter server should be running version 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5<br/><br/> An ESXi host running version 5.5, 6.0 or 6.5<br/><br/> One or more VMware VMs running on the ESXi host.<br/><br/> VMs must meet [Azure requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#azure-vm-requirements).<br/><br/> Supported [network](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#network) and [storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#storage) configuration.
**DMS** | For DMS you need a [compatible on-premises VPN device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices).<br/><br/> You must be able to configure the on-premises VPN device. It must have an externally facing public IPv4 address, and the address can't be located behind a NAT device.<br/><br/> Make sure you have access to your on-premises SQL Server database.<br/><br/> The Windows Firewall should be able to access the source database engine. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-windows-firewall-for-database-engine-access).<br/><br/> If there's a firewall in front of your database machine, add rules to allow access to the database, and to files via SMB port 445.<br/><br/> The credentials used to connect to the source SQL Server and target Managed Instance must be members of the sysadmin server role.<br/><br/> You need a network share in your on-premises database that DMS can use to back up the source database.<br/><br/> Make sure that the service account running the source SQL Server instance has write privileges on the network share.<br/><br/> Make a note of a Windows user (and password) that has full control privilege on the network share. The Azure Database Migration Service impersonates these user credentials to upload backup files to the Azure storage container.<br/><br/> The SQL Server Express installation process sets the TCP/IP protocol to **Disabled** by default. Make sure that it's enabled.


## Scenario steps

Here's what we're going to do for this migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Step 1: Set up a SQL Azure Managed Instance**: You need a pre-created managed instance to which the on-premises SQL Server database will migrate.
> * **Step 2: Prepare DMS**: You register the Database Migration provider, create an instance, and then create a DMS project. You'll also need to set up SA URI for DMS. A shared access signature (SAS) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides delegated access to resources in your storage account, so that you can grant limited permissions to storage objects. Set up a SAS URI so that the DMS can access the storage account container to which the service uploads the SQL Server back-up files.
> * **Step 3: Prepare Azure for Site Recovery**: You create an Azure storage account to hold replicated data, and create a Recovery Services vault.
> * **Step 4: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery**: You prepare accounts for VM discovery and agent installation, and prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover.
> * **Step 5: Replicate VMs**: You configure the Site Recovery source and target environment, set up a replication policy, and start replicating VMs to Azure storage.
> * **Step 6: Migrate the database with DMS**: Run a database migration.
> * **Step 7: Migrate the VMs with Site Recovery**: Run a test failover to make sure everything's working, and then run a full failover to migrate the VMs to Azure.


## Step 1: Prepare an Azure SQL Managed Instance

To set up an Azure SQL Managed Instance, you need a subnet:

- The subnet must be dedicated. It must be empty and not contain any other cloud service, and it mustn't be a gateway subnet.
- After the managed instance is created, you mustn't add resources to the subnet.
- The subnet mustn't have an NSG associated with it.
- The subnet must have a User Route Table (UDR) with 0.0.0.0/0 Next Hop Internet as the only route assigned to it. 
- Optional custom DNS: If custom DNS is specified on the VNet, Azure's recursive resolvers IP address (such as 168.63.129.16) must be added to the list. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-custom-dns).
- The subnet mustn't have a service endpoint (storage or SQL) associated with it. Service endpoints should be disabled on the virtual network.
- The subnet must have minimum of 16 IP addresses. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-vnet-configuration#determine-the-size-of-subnet-for-managed-instances) about sizing the managed instance subnet.
- In their hybrid environment, custom DNS settings are needed. Contoso will configure DNS settings to use one or more of their Azure DNS servers. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-custom-dns) about DNS customization.

### Set up a virtual network for the managed instance

Contoso sets up the VNet as follows: 
1. Contoso creates a new VNet (VNET-SQLMI-EU2) in the primary East US 2 region, in the ContosoNetworkingRG resource group.
2. Contoso assigns an address space of 10.235.0.0/24, ensuring that the range doesn't overlap with any other networks in the Contoso enterprise.
2. They add two subnets to the network:
    - SQLMI-DS-EUS2 (10.235.0.0.25)
    - SQLMI-SAW-EUS2 (10.235.0.128/29). This subnet will be used to attach directory to the managed instance (SQLMI).

    ![Managed Instance network](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-vnet.png)

6. After the VNet and subnets are deployed, Contoso peers networks as follows:

    - Peers VNET-SQLMI-EUS2 with VNET-HUB-EUS2 (the hub VNet for the East US 2).
    - Peers VNET-SQLMI-EUS2 with VNET-PROD-EUS2 (the production network).

    ![Network peering](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-peering.png)

7. Contoso sets custom DNS settings. DNS will point first to their Azure DCs. Azure DNS will be secondary. The Contoso Azure DCs are located as follows:

    - Located in the PROD-DC-EUS2 subnet, in the East US 2 production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2).
    - CONTOSODC3 address: 10.245.42.4
    - CONTOSODC4 address: 10.245.42.5
    - Azure DNS resolver: 168.63.129.16

     ![Network DNS](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-dns.png)

### Set up routing

The Managed Instance is placed in a private VNET, so you need a route table for it to communicate with the Azure Management Service. If it can't communicate with the service that manages it, it will become inaccessible.

- The route table contains a set of rules (routes) that specifies how packets sent from Managed Instance should be routed in the VNet.
- The route table is associated with subnets in which Managed Instances are deployed. Each packet leaving a subnet is handled based on the associated route table.
- A subnet can only be associated with a single route table.
- There are no additional charges for creating route tables in Microsoft Azure.

1. Contoso creates a user-defined route table. The route table is created in the  ContosoNetworkingRG resource group.

    ![Route table](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table.png)

2. After the route table (MIRouteTable)is deployed, to comply with Managed Instance requirement, Contoso add a route with an address prefix of 0.0.0.0/0, and **Next hop type** set to **Internet**.

    ![Route table prefix](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table-prefix.png)
    
3. Contoso associate the route table with the SQLMI-DB-EUS2 subnet (in the VNET-SQLMI-EUS2 network). 

    ![Route table subnet](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-route-table-subnet.png)

### Create a managed instance

Now, Contoso can provision a SQL Database Managed Instance.

1. Since the Managed Instance serves a business app, Contoso deploy it in their primary East US 2 region, in the ContosoRG resource group, 
2. They select a pricing tier, and size compute and storage for the instance. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/managed/) about pricing.

    ![Managed instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-create.png)

3. After the Managed Instance is deployed, two new resources appear in the ContosoRG resource group:

- A virtual cluster in case you have multiple managed instances,
- The SQL Server Managed Instance. 

![Managed instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-resources.png)

**Need more help?**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-create-tutorial-portal) provisioning a Managed Instance.

## Step 2: Prepare DMS

To prepare DMS you need a couple of things:

- Register the DMS provider in Azure
- Provide DMS with access to Azure storage for uploading the backup files used to migrate a database. Do this by creating a blob storage container and generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI for it. 
- Create a DMS project.


Complete the steps as follows:

1. Contoso register the Database Migration provider under their subscription.
    ![DMS register](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-subscription.png)

2. They create a storage blob container and generate an SAS URI so that DMS can access it.

    ![SAS URI](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-sas.png)

3. Finally, they create a DMS instance. 

    ![DMS instance](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-instance.png)

4. Contoso places the DMS instance in the PROD-DC-EUS2 subnet of the VNET-PROD-DC-EUS2 VNet.
    - They place it there because it must be in a VNet that can access the on-premises SQL Server VM via a VPN gateway.
    - The VNET-PROD-EUS2 is peered to VNET-HUB-EUS2, and is allowed to use remote gateways.  This ensures that DMS will be able to communicate as required.

    ![DMS network](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-network.png)

- [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2) about creating and using SAS.


## Step 3: Prepare Azure for the Site Recovery service

There are a number of elements you need in Azure for Site Recovery:

- A VNet in which failed over resources are located.
- An Azure storage account to hold replicated data. 
- A Recovery Services vault in Azure.

Contoso are planning to migrate their web tier VM (WEBVM) to Azure using Site Recovery. They set up Site Recovery as follows:

1. Since the VM is a web frontend to the SmartHotel app, they will fail over the VM to their production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2) and subnet (PROD-FE-EUS2), in the primary East US 2 region. 
1. Contoso create an Azure storage acount (contosovmsacc20180528). They're using a general purpose account, with standard storage, and LRS replication.

    ![Site Recovery storage](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/asr-storage.png)

3. With the network and storage account in place, Contoso create a vault (ContosoMigrationVault), and place it in the ContosoFailoverRG resource group, in the primary East US 2 region.

    ![Recovery Services vault](media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/asr-vault.png)

**Need more help?**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure) setting up Azure for Site Recovery.


## Step 4: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery

To prepare VMware for Site Recovery, here's what you need to do:

- Prepare an account on the vCenter server or vSphere ESXi host, to automate VM discovery.
- Prepare an account that allows automatic installation of the Mobility service on VMware VMs that you want to replicate.
- Prepare on-premises VMs, if you want to connect to Azure VMs when they're created after failover.


### Prepare an account for automatic discovery

Site Recovery needs access to VMware servers to:

- Automatically discover VMs. At least a read-only account is required.
- Orchestrate replication, failover, and failback. You need an account that can run operations such as creating and removing disks, and turning on VMs.

Contoso sets up the account as follows:

1. Contoso creates a role at the vCenter level.
2. Contoso then assigns that role the required permissions.

**Need more help?**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-automatic-discovery) creating and assigning a role for automatic discovery.

### Prepare an account for Mobility service installation

The Mobility service must be installed on the VM you want to replicate.

- Site Recovery can do an automatic push installation of this component when you enable replication for the VM.
- For automatic push installation, you need to prepare an account that Site Recovery will use to access the VM.
- You specify this account when you set up replication in the Azure console.
- You need a domain or local account with permissions to install on the VM.

**Need more help**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-mobility-service-installation) creating an account for push installation of the Mobility service.


### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover

After failover to Azure, Contoso wants to be able to connect to the replicated VMs in Azure. To do this, there's a couple of things they need to do on the on-premises VM, before they run the migration: 

1. For access over the internet, they enable RDP on the on-premises VM before failover, and ensure that TCP and UDP rules are added for the **Public** profile, and that RDP is allowed in **Windows Firewall** > **Allowed Apps** for all profiles.
2. For access over their site-to-site VPN, they enable RDP on the on-premises machine, and allow RDP in the **Windows Firewall** -> **Allowed apps and features** for **Domain and Private** networks.
3. They set the operating system's SAN policy on the on-premises VM to **OnlineAll**.

In addition, when they run a failover they need to check the following:

- There should be no Windows updates pending on the VM when triggering a failover. If there are, they won't be able to log in to the virtual machine until the update completes.
- After failover, they should check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM. If this doesn't work, they should check that the VM is running and review these [troubleshooting tips](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).


## Step 5: Replicate the on-premises VMs to Azure with Site Recovery

Before they can run a migration to Azure, Contoso need to set up replication, and enable replication for their on-premises VM.

### Set a replication goal

1. In the vault, under the vault name (ContosoVMVault) they set a replication goal (**Getting Started** > **Site Recovery** > **PRepare infrastructure**.
2. They specify that their machines are located on-premises, that they're VMware VMs, and that they want to replicate to Azure.

    ![Replication goal](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-goal.png)

### Confirm deployment planning

To continue, they need to confirm that they have completed deployment planning, by selecting **Yes, I have done it**.

### Set up the source environment

Now they need to configure their source environment. To do this they download an OVF template and used it to deploy the configuration server and its associated components as a highly available, on-premises VMware VM. Components on the server include:

- The configuration server that coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure and manages data replication.
- The process server that acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption; and sends it to Azure storage.
- The process server also installs Mobility Service on VMs you want to replicate and performs automatic discovery of on-premises VMware VMs.

After the configuration server VM is created and started, they register it in the vault.


Contoso perform these steps as follows:

1. They download the OVF template. r (**Prepare Infrastructure** > **Source** > **Configuration Server**).
    
    ![Download OVF](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/add-cs.png)

2. They import the template into VMware to create the VM, and deploy the VM.

    ![OVF template](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/vcenter-wizard.png)

3.  When they turn on the VM for the first time, it boots up into a Windows Server 2016 installation experience. They accept the license agreement, and enter an administrator password.

4. After the installation finishes, they sign in to the VM as the administrator. At first-time sign in, the Azure Site Recovery Configuration Tool runs by default.
5. In the tool, they specify a name to use for registering the configuration server in the vault.
6. The tool checks that the VM can connect to Azure. After the connection is established, select **Sign in** to sign in to your Azure subscription. The credentials must have access to the vault in which you want to register the configuration server.

    [Register configuration server](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/config-server-register2.png)

7. The tool performs some configuration tasks and then reboots. They sign in to the machine again, and the configuration server management wizard starts automatically.
8. In the Configuration Server Management wizard, they select the NIC to receive replication traffic. This setting can't be changed after it's configured.
9. They select the subscription, resource group, and vault in which to register the configuration server.
        ![vault](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/cswiz1.png) 

10. They then download and install MySQL Server, and VMWare PowerCLI. Then validate the server settings.
11. After settings are validated, they specify the FQDN or IP address of the vCenter server or vSphere host, on which the VM is located. They leave the default port, and specify a friendly name for the vCenter server in Azure.
12. They need to specify the account that they created earlier, so that Site Recovery can automatically discover VMware VMs that are available for replication. 
13. They then specify the credentials that are used to automatically install Mobility Service on machines, when replication is enabled. For Windows machines, the account needs local administrator privileges on the machines you want to replicate. 

    ![vCenter](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/cswiz2.png)

7. After registration finishes, in the Azure portal, Contoso double checks that the configuration server and VMware server are listed on the **Source** page in the vault. Discovery can take 15 minutes or more. 
8. Site Recovery then connects to VMware servers using the specified settings and discovers VMs.

### Set up the target

Now Contoso needs to specify their target replication environment.

1. In **Prepare infrastructure** > **Target**, they select the target settings.
2. Site Recovery checks that there's a Azure storage account and network in the specified target.

### Create a replication policy

After the source and target are set up, Contoso is ready to create a replication policy, and associate it with the configuration server.

1. In  **Prepare infrastructure** > **Replication Settings** > **Replication Policy** >  **Create and Associate**, they create a policy **ContosoMigrationPolicy**.
2. They use the default settings:
    - **RPO threshold**: Default of 60 minutes. This value defines how often recovery points are created. An alert is generated if continuous replication exceeds this limit.
    - **Recovery point retention**. Default of 24 hours. This value specifies how long the retention window is for each recovery point. Replicated VMs can be recovered to any point in a window.
    - **App-consistent snapshot frequency**. Default of one hour. This value specifies the frequency at which application-consistent snapshots are created.
 
        ![Create replication policy](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-policy.png)

5. The policy is automatically associated with the configuration server. 

    ![Associate replication policy](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/replication-policy2.png)

### Enable replication

Now Contoso can start replicating the WebVM.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **+Replicate** they select the source settings.
2. They select that they want to enable virtual machines, select the vCenter server, and the configuration server.


![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication1.png)

3. Now, they specify the target settings, including the resource group in which the Azure VM will be located after failover, the storage account in which replicated data will be stored, and the Azure network/subnet in which the Azure VM will be located when it's created after failover. 

     ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication2.png)

3. Contoso selects the WebVM for replication. Site Recovery installs the Mobility Service on each VM when you enable replication for it. 

    ![Enable replication](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/enable-replication3.png)

4. Contoso checks that the correct replication policy is selected, and enables replication for WEBVM. They track replication progress in **Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs, the machine is ready for failover.
5. In **Essentials** in the Azure portal, Contoso can see the structure for the VMs replicating to Azure.

## Step 6: Migrate the database with DMS

Contoso need to create a DMS project, and migrate the database.

### Create a DMS project
1. Contoso create a DMS project. They specify the source server type as SQL Server, and the target as Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

![DMS project](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-project.png)

2. After creating the project, the Migration Wizard opens.

### Migrate the database 

1. In the Migration Wizard, Contoso specify the source VM on which the on-premises database is located, and credentials to access it.

    ![DMS source](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-wizard-source.png)

2. They select the database to migrate (SmartHotel.Registration).

    ![DMS source database](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-wizard-sourcedb.png)

3. As a target, they specified the name of the Managed Instance in Azure, and access credentials.

    ![DMS target](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-target-details.png)

4. Then, in **+New Activity** > **Run Migration**, they specify settings to run migration:
    - Source and target credentials.
    - Database to migrate.
    - The network share they created on the on-premises VM. DMS takes source backups to this share. The service account running the source SQL Server instance must have write privileges on this share.
    - The SAS URI that provides the DMS with access to storage account container to which the service uploads the backup files for migration.
5. They save the migration, and run it.
6. In **Overview**, they monitor the migration status.

    ![DMS monitor](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-monitor1.png)

7. After migration completes, they verify that the target databases exist on the managed instance.

    ![DMS monitor](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/dms-monitor2.png)

## Step 7: Migrate the VM with Site Recovery

Contoso run a quick test failover, and then migrate the VM.

### Run a test failover

Before migrating WEBVM, Contoso run a test failover to make sure that everything's working as expected. 

1. Contoso runs a test failover, to the latest available point in time (Latest processed).
2. They select **Shut down machine before beginning failover**, so that Site Recovery attempts to shut down the source VM before triggering the failover. Failover continues even if shutdown fails. 
3. Test failover runs: 

    - A prerequisites check runs to make sure all of the conditions required for migration are in place.
    - Failover processes the data, so that an Azure VM can be created. If select the latest recovery point, a recovery point is created from the data.
    - An Azure VM is created using the data processed in the previous step.
3. After the failover finishes, the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal. Contoso checks that everything is working properly. The VM is the appropriate size,  it's connected to the right network, and it's running. 
4. After verifying the test failover, Contoso clean up the failover, and record and save any observations. 

### Migrate the VM

1. After verifying that the test failover worked as expected, Contoso create a recovery plan for migration. They add WEBVM to the plan.

     ![Recovery plan](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/recovery-plan.png)

2. Then, they run a failover on the plan. They select the latest recovery point, and specify that Site Recovery should try to shut down the on-premises VM before triggering the failover.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover1.png)

3. After the failover, Contoso verify that the Azure VM appears as expected in the Azure portal.

    ![Recovery plan](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover2.png)

6. After verifying the VM in Azure, they complete the migration to finish the migration process, stop replication for the VM, and stop Site Recovery billing for the VM.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover3.png)

### Update the connection string

As the final step in the migration process, Contoso update the connection string of the application to point to the migrated database running on their SQL MI.

1. In the Azure portal them find the connection string by clicking **Settings** > **Connection Strings**.

    ![Failover](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover4.png)  

2. They update the string with the user name and password of the SQL MI.
3. After the string is configured, they replace the current connection string in the web.config file of their application.
4. After updating the file and saving it, they restart IIS on WEBVM. They do this using the IISRESET /RESTART from a cmd prompt.
5. After IIS has been restarted, the application is now be using the database running on the SQL MI.
6. At this point Contoso can shut down the SQLVM machine on-premises, and the migration is complete.

## Step 8: Clean up after migration

With migration complete, the SmartHotel app is running on an Azure VM, and the SmartHotel database is available on the Azure SQL Managed Instance.  

Now, Contoso needs to do some cleanup:  

- They remove the WEBVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- They remote the SQLVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- They remove WEBVM and SQLVM from local backup jobs.
- They update their internal documentation show the new location, IP Address for WEBVM.
- They remove SQLVM from documentation. Alternatively, they could mark it to show as deleted and no longer in the VM inventory.
- They review any resources that interact with the decommissioned VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.

## Step 9: Review the deployment

With the migrated resources in Azure, Contoso need to fully operationalize and secure their new infrastructure.

### Security

The Contoso security team review the Azure VM WEBVM to determine any security issues with its implementation.

- They review the Network Security Groups (NSGs) for the VM to control access. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the application can pass.
- They are also considering securing the data on the disk using Disk encryption and Azure KeyVault.
- They enable threat detection on the Managed Instance (SQLMI). They will send alerts to their security team/service desk system to open a ticket if a threat is detected. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-threat-detection).

     ![Managed instance security](./media/contoso-migration-rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/mi-security.png)  

[Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#vm-authentication-and-access-control) about security practices for VMs.

### Backups

Azure are going to back up the data on WEBVM using the Azure Backup service. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

### Licensing and cost optimization

1. Contoso has existing licensing for their WEBVM and will be leveraging the Azure Hybrid Benefit.  They will convert the existing Azure VM to take advantage of this pricing.

2. Contoso will enable Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary. It's a multi-cloud cost management solution that helps you to utilize and manage Azure and other cloud resources.  [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/overview) about Azure Cost Management.
