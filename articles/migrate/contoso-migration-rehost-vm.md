# Contoso series: Rehost (migrate) an on-premises app to Azure VMs 

This article shows Contoso are rehosting their on-premises two-tier SmartHotel app by migrating it to Azure, using the Azure Site Recovery service. If you'd like to use the sample app used in this article, you can download it from [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360).

This document is one in a series of articles that document how the fictitious company Contoso migrates their on-premises resources to the Microsoft Azure cloud. The series includes background information, and a series of scenarios that illustrate how to set up a migration infrastructure, assess the suitability of on-premises resources for migration, and run different types of migrations. Scenarios grow in complexity, and we'll be adding additional articles over time.

2. Migrate to an Azure VM and SQL Server Availability Group | Rehost (lift-and-shift) | In this article, Contoso rehosts the tiered on-premises app frontened to an Azure VM, and the app database to an Azure SQL Server availability group.



## Business drivers

The IT Leadership team has worked closely with their business partners to understand what the business wants to achieve with this migration:

- **Address business growth**: Contoso is growing and as a result there is pressure on their on-premises systems and infrastructure.
- **Limit risk**: The SmartHotel app is critical for the Contoso business. They want to move it to Azure with zero risk.
- **Extend**:  Contoso doesn't want to modify the app. They simply want to ensure that it's stable.


## Migration goals

The Contoso cloud team has pinned down goals for this migration. These goals are used to determine the best migration method:

- After migration, the app in Azure should have the same performance capabilities as it does today in their on-premises VMWare environment.  The app will remain as critical in the cloud as it is on-premises. 
- Contoso doesnâ€™t want to invest in this app.  It is critical and important to the business, but in its current form they simply want to move it safely to the cloud.
- Contoso doesn't want to change the ops model for this app. They want to continue to interact with it in the cloud in the same way that they do now.
- Contoso doesn't want to change app functionality. Only the app location will change.

## Proposed architecture

In this scenario:

- Contoso wants to migrate their two-tier on-premises travel app.
- The app is tiered across two VMs (WEBVM and SQLVM), and located on VMware ESXi host **contosohost1.contoso.com** (version 6.5)
- The VMware environment is managed by vCenter Server 6.5 (**vcenter.contoso.com**), running on a VM.
- They'll migrate both the app VMs to Azure.
- Contoso has an on-premises datacenter (contoso-datacenter), with an on-premises domain controller (**contosodc1**).
- The on-premises VMs in the Contoso datacenter will be decommissioned after the migration is done.

### Azure services

**Service** | **Description** | **Cost**
--- | --- | ---
[Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/) | The service orchestrates and manages migration and disaster recovery for Azure VMs, and on-premises VMs and physical servers.  | During replication to Azure, Azure Storage charges are incurred.  Azure VMs are created, and incur charges, when failover occurs. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/) about charges and pricing.

 

## Migration process

Contoso will migrate the two VMs running their tiered SmartHotel application to Azure.

1. Contoso already have their Azure infrastructure in place, so they need to add a couple of Azure components for this scenario, prepare their on-premises VMware environment, and enable replication for the VMs.
2. After VMs are replicating to Azure, they'll migrate the VMs to Azure by running a failover from their on-premises site.

DIAGRAM TBD

## Scenario steps

Here's what we're going to do for this migration:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Step 1: Prepare Azure for Site Recovery**: You create an Azure storage account to hold replicated data, and create a Recovery Services vault.
> * **Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery**: You prepare accounts for VM discovery and agent installation, and prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover.
> * **Step 3: Replicate VMs**: You configure the Site Recovery source and target environment, set up a replication policy, and start replicating VMs to Azure storage.
> * **Step 4: Migrate the VMs with Site Recovery**: Run a test failover to make sure everything's working, and then run a full failover to migrate the VMs to Azure.




## Step 1: Prepare Azure for the Site Recovery service

There are a number of elements you need in Azure for Site Recovery:

- A VNet in which failed over resources are located.
- An Azure storage account to hold replicated data. 
- A Recovery Services vault in Azure.

Contoso are planning to migrate their web tier VM (WEBVM) and database VM (SQLVM) to Azure using Site Recovery. They set up Site Recovery as follows:

1. Since the VMs host the SmartHotel app, they will fail them over to their production network, in the primary East US 2 region. Both VMs will be in the ContosoRG resource group. This is the resource group Contoso uses for production resources.

    - WEBVM, containing the app frontend, will migrate to the frontend subnet (PROD-FE-EUS2), in the production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2).
    - SQLVM, containing the database, will migrate to the database subnet (PROD-DB-EUS2), in the production network (VNET-PROD-EUS2).
2. Contoso create an Azure storage acount (contosovmsacc20180528) in the East US 2 region. The storage account must be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault. They're using a general purpose account, with standard storage, and LRS replication. They 

    ![Site Recovery storage](media/rehost-vm/asr-storage.png)

3. With the network and storage account in place, Contoso create a vault (ContosoMigrationVault), and place it in the ContosoFailoverRG resource group, in the primary East US 2 region.

    ![Recovery Services vault](media/rehost-vm/asr-vault.png)

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure) setting up Azure for Site Recovery.


## Step 2: Prepare on-premises VMware for Site Recovery

To prepare VMware for Site Recovery, here's what you need to do:

- Prepare an account on the vCenter server or vSphere ESXi host, to automate VM discovery.
- Prepare an account that allows automatic installation of the Mobility service on VMware VMs that you want to replicate.
- Prepare on-premises VMs, if you want to connect to Azure VMs when they're created after failover.


### Prepare an account for automatic discovery

Site Recovery needs access to VMware servers to:

- Automatically discover VMs. At least a read-only account is required.
- Orchestrate replication, failover, and failback. You need an account that can run operations such as creating and removing disks, and turning on VMs.

Contoso sets up the account as follows:

1. Contoso creates a role at the vCenter level.
2. Contoso then assigns that role the required permissions.

**Need more help?**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-automatic-discovery) creating and assigning a role for automatic discovery.

### Prepare an account for Mobility service installation

The Mobility service must be installed on the VM you want to replicate.

- Site Recovery can do an automatic push installation of this component when you enable replication for the VMs.
- For automatic push installation, you need to prepare an account that Site Recovery will use to access the VMs.
- You specify this account when you set up replication in the Azure console.
- You need a domain or local account with permissions to install on the VMs.

**Need more help**

[Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises#prepare-an-account-for-mobility-service-installation) creating an account for push installation of the Mobility service.


### Prepare to connect to Azure VMs after failover

After failover to Azure, Contoso wants to be able to connect to the replicated VMs in Azure. To do this, there's a couple of things they need to do on the on-premises VM, before they run the migration: 

1. For access over the internet, they enable RDP on the on-premises VM before failover, and ensure that TCP and UDP rules are added for the **Public** profile, and that RDP is allowed in **Windows Firewall** > **Allowed Apps** for all profiles.
2. For access over their site-to-site VPN, they enable RDP on the on-premises machine, and allow RDP in the **Windows Firewall** -> **Allowed apps and features** for **Domain and Private** networks.
3. They set the operating system's SAN policy on the on-premises VM to **OnlineAll**.

In addition, when they run a failover they need to check the following:

- There should be no Windows updates pending on the VM when triggering a failover. If there are, they won't be able to log in to the virtual machine until the update completes.
- After failover, they should check **Boot diagnostics** to view a screenshot of the VM. If this doesn't work, they should check that the VM is running and review these [troubleshooting tips](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).


## Step 3: Replicate the on-premises VMs

Before they can run a migration to Azure, Contoso need to set up replication, and enable replication for their on-premises VM.

### Set a replication goal

1. In the vault, under the vault name (ContosoVMVault) they set a replication goal (**Getting Started** > **Site Recovery** > **PRepare infrastructure**.
2. They specify that their machines are located on-premises, that they're VMware VMs, and that they want to replicate to Azure.

    ![Replication goal](./media/rehost-vm/replication-goal.png)

### Confirm deployment planning

To continue, they need to confirm that they have completed deployment planning, by selecting **Yes, I have done it**.

### Set up the source environment

Now they need to configure their source environment. To do this they download an OVF template and used it to deploy the configuration server and its associated components as a highly available, on-premises VMware VM. Components on the server include:

- The configuration server that coordinates communications between on-premises and Azure and manages data replication.
- The process server that acts as a replication gateway. It receives replication data; optimizes it with caching, compression, and encryption; and sends it to Azure storage.
- The process server also installs Mobility Service on VMs you want to replicate and performs automatic discovery of on-premises VMware VMs.

After the configuration server VM is created and started, they register it in the vault.


Contoso perform these steps as follows:

1. They download the OVF template from **Prepare Infrastructure** > **Source** > **Configuration Server**.
    
    ![Download OVF](./media/rehost-vm/add-cs.png)

2. They import the template into VMware to create the VM, and deploy the VM.

    ![OVF template](./media/rehost-vm/vcenter-wizard.png)

3.  When they turn on the VM for the first time, it boots up into a Windows Server 2016 installation experience. They accept the license agreement, and enter an administrator password.

4. After the installation finishes, they sign in to the VM as the administrator. At first-time sign in, the Azure Site Recovery Configuration Tool runs by default.
5. In the tool, they specify a name to use for registering the configuration server in the vault.
6. The tool checks that the VM can connect to Azure. After the connection is established, select **Sign in** to sign in to your Azure subscription. The credentials must have access to the vault in which you want to register the configuration server.

    [Register configuration server](./media/rehost-vm/config-server-register2.png)

7. The tool performs some configuration tasks and then reboots. They sign in to the machine again, and the configuration server management wizard starts automatically.
8. In the Configuration Server Management wizard, they select the NIC to receive replication traffic. This setting can't be changed after it's configured.
9. They select the subscription, resource group, and vault in which to register the configuration server.
        ![vault](./media/rehost-vm-cswiz1.png) 

10. They then download and install MySQL Server, and VMWare PowerCLI. Then validate the server settings.
11. After settings are validated, they specify the FQDN or IP address of the vCenter server or vSphere host, on which the VM is located. They leave the default port, and specify a friendly name for the vCenter server in Azure.
12. They need to specify the account that they created earlier, so that Site Recovery can automatically discover VMware VMs that are available for replication. 
13. They then specify the credentials that are used to automatically install Mobility Service on machines, when replication is enabled. For Windows machines, the account needs local administrator privileges on the machines you want to replicate. 

    ![vCenter](./media/rehost-vm/cswiz2.png)

7. After registration finishes, in the Azure portal, Contoso double checks that the configuration server and VMware server are listed on the **Source** page in the vault. Discovery can take 15 minutes or more. 
8. Site Recovery then connects to VMware servers using the specified settings and discovers VMs.

### Set up the target

Now Contoso needs to specify their target replication environment.

1. In **Prepare infrastructure** > **Target**, they select the target settings.
2. Site Recovery checks that there's a Azure storage account and network in the specified target.

### Create a replication policy

After the source and target are set up, Contoso is ready to create a replication policy, and associate it with the configuration server.

1. In  **Prepare infrastructure** > **Replication Settings** > **Replication Policy** >  **Create and Associate**, they create a policy **ContosoMigrationPolicy**.
2. They use the default settings:
    - **RPO threshold**: Default of 60 minutes. This value defines how often recovery points are created. An alert is generated if continuous replication exceeds this limit.
    - **Recovery point retention**. Default of 24 hours. This value specifies how long the retention window is for each recovery point. Replicated VMs can be recovered to any point in a window.
    - **App-consistent snapshot frequency**. Default of one hour. This value specifies the frequency at which application-consistent snapshots are created.
 
        ![Create replication policy](./media/rehost-vm/replication-policy.png)

5. The policy is automatically associated with the configuration server. 

    ![Associate replication policy](./media/rehost-vm/replication-policy2.png)


**Need more help?**

- You can read a full walkthrough of all these steps in [Set up disaster recovery for on-premises VMware VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial).
- Detailed instructions are available to help you [set up the source environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-set-up-source), [deploy the configuration server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-deploy-configuration-server), and [configure replication settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-set-up-replication).

### Enable replication for WEBVM

Now Contoso can start replicating the WebVM.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **+Replicate** they select the source settings.
2. They select that they want to enable virtual machines, select the vCenter server, and the configuration server.

    ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication1.png)

3. Now, they specify the target settings, including the resource group in which the Azure VM will be located after failover, the storage account in which replicated data will be stored, and the Azure network/subnet in which the Azure VM will be located when it's created after failover. 

     ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication2.png)

3. Contoso selects the WebVM for replication. 

    - At this stage Contoso selects only WEBVM because VNet and subnet must be selected,and the VMs aren't in the same subnet.
    - Site Recovery automatically installs the Mobility service when replication is enabled for the VM.

    ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication3.png)

4. Contoso checks that the correct replication policy is selected, and enables replication for WEBVM. They track replication progress in **Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs, the machine is ready for failover.


### Enable replication for SQLVM

Now Contoso can start replicating SQLVM.

1. In **Replicate application** > **Source** > **+Replicate** they select the source settings.
2. They select that they want to enable virtual machines, select the vCenter server, and the configuration server.

    ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication1.png)

3. Now, they specify the target settings, including the resource group in which the Azure VM will be located after failover, the storage account in which replicated data will be stored, and the Azure network/subnet in which the Azure VM will be located when it's created after failover. 

     ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication2-sqlvm.png)

3. Contoso selects the SQLVM for replication. Site Recovery automatically installs the Mobility service when replication is enabled for the VM.

    ![Enable replication](./media/rehost-vm/enable-replication3-sqlvm.png)

4. Contoso applies the same replication policy that was used for WEBVM, and enables replication for SQLVM. They track replication progress in **Jobs**. After the **Finalize Protection** job runs, the machine is ready for failover.
5. In **Essentials** in the Azure portal, Contoso can see the structure for the VMs replicating to Azure.

    ![Infrastructure view](./media/rehost-vm/essentials.png)


**Need more help?**

You can read a full walkthrough of all these steps in [Enable replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-enable-replication).


## Step 4: Migrate the VMs 

Contoso run a quick test failover, and then migrate the VMs.

### Run a test failover

Before migrating the VMs, Contoso run a test failover to make sure that everything's working as expected. 

1. Contoso runs a test failover, to the latest available point in time (Latest processed).
2. They select **Shut down machine before beginning failover**, so that Site Recovery attempts to shut down the source VM before triggering the failover. Failover continues even if shutdown fails. 
3. Test failover runs: 

    - A prerequisites check runs to make sure all of the conditions required for migration are in place.
    - Failover processes the data, so that an Azure VM can be created. If select the latest recovery point, a recovery point is created from the data.
    - An Azure VM is created using the data processed in the previous step.
3. After the failover finishes, the replica Azure VM appears in the Azure portal. Contoso checks that everything is working properly. The VM is the appropriate size,  it's connected to the right network, and it's running. 
4. After verifying the test failover, Contoso clean up the failover, and record and save any observations. 

### Create and customize a recovery plan

 After verifying that the test failover worked as expected, Contoso create a recovery plan for migration. 

- A recovery plan specifies the order in which failover occurs, how Azure VMs will be brought up in Azure.
- Since they want to migrate a two-tier app, they'll customize the recovery plan so that the data VM (SQLVM) starts before the frontend (WEBVM).


1. In **Recovery Plans (Site Recovery)** > **+Recovery Plan**, they create a plan and add the VMs to it.

    ![Recovery plan](./media/rehost-vm/recovery-plan.png)

2. After creating the plan, they select it for customization (**Recovery Plans** > **SmartHotelMigrationPlan** > **Customize**.
2.	They remove WEBVM from **Group 1: Start**.  This ensures that the first start action affects SQLVM only.
3.	In **+Group** > **Add protected items**, they add WEBVM to Group 2: Start.  Contoso needs these to be in two different groups.


### Migrate the VMs


Now Contoso are ready to run a failover on the recovery plan, to migrate the VMs.

1. They select the plan > **Failover**.
2.  They select to fail over to the latest recovery point, and specify that Site Recovery should try to shut down the on-premises VM before triggering the failover. They can follow the failover progress on the **Jobs** page.

    ![Failover](./media/rehost-vm/failover1.png)


3. After the failover, Contoso verify that the Azure VM appears as expected in the Azure portal.

    ![Failover](./media/rehost-vm/failover2.png)  

3. After verifying the VM in Azure, they complete the migration to finish the migration process for each VM. This stops replication for the VM, and stop Site Recovery billing for the VM.

    ![Failover](./media/rehost-vm-sql-managed-instance/failover3.png)

- [Learn about](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-failover) failing over to Azure.

## Step 5: Clean up after migration

With migration complete, the SmartHotel app tiers are running on Azure VMs.

Now, Contoso needs to do some cleanup:  

- They remove the WEBVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- They remote the SQLVM machine from the vCenter inventory.
- They remove WEBVM and SQLVM from local backup jobs.
- They update their internal documentation show the new location, and IP Address for WEBVM and SQLVM.
- They review any resources that interact with the VMs, and update any relevant settings or documentation to reflect the new configuration.

## Step 9: Review the deployment

With the app now running, Contoso need to fully operationalize and secure their new infrastructure.

### Security

The Contoso security team review the Azure VM WEBVM to determine any security issues with its implementation.

- They review the Network Security Groups (NSGs) for the VM to control access. NSGs are used to ensure that only traffic allowed to the application can pass.
- They are also considering securing the data on the disk using Disk encryption and Azure KeyVault.

[Read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#vm-authentication-and-access-control) about security practices for VMs.

### Backups

Azure are going to back up the data on the VMs using the Azure Backup service. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-introduction-to-azure-backup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

### Licensing and cost optimization

1. Contoso has existing licensing for their VMs, and will be leveraging the Azure Hybrid Benefit.  They will convert the existing Azure VMs to take advantage of this pricing.

2. Contoso will enable Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary. It's a multi-cloud cost management solution that helps you to utilize and manage Azure and other cloud resources.  [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management/overview) about Azure Cost Management. 


## Next steps

In this scenario we showed the third scenario in the Contoso series. We migrated an on-premises SmartHotel app tiered over two VMs to Azure.

In the fourth article in the series, we'll show how Contoso migrate their frontend VM for the SmartHotel app to an Azure VM, and migrate their database VM to a SQL Server Always-On Availability group running on an Azure VM.
